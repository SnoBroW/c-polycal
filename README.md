# c-polycal

A tty polynomial calculator in C


This is like the description suggests a polynomial calculater for your terminal. I'm about 60% done with this project, and there's a lot to add, but I thought I'd share it here for anyone who needs it and to track my progress.

So far it can only give out the sum of two polynomials and the value for a set X.

You can input polynomials either by hand or read from a text file, same for output.

There are a lot of issues which I won't list here, but if you find any bug I'd be happy to know it, feel free to comment :)

Thanks for reading me, enjoy using the calculator!
